## **🚧 CURRENT LIMITATIONS & NEXT STEPS**

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Testing Framework:** 100% Complete and Operational
- ⏳ **COD Module Implementation:** In Progress
- ⏳ **Test Data Setup:** Requires database seeding
- ⏳ **UI Components:** Need data-testid attributes for reliable testing

### **Required for Full Test Execution:**

1. **Application Prerequisites:**
   - COD module UI components implemented
   - COD API endpoints functional
   - Database with test data
   - Authentication system working

2. **Test Environment Setup:**
   - Test users created in database
   - Sample containers and depots available
   - COD requests in various states for testing

3. **UI Testing Enhancements:**
   - Add `data-testid` attributes to COD components
   - Ensure consistent element selectors
   - Implement proper loading states

### **Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Complete COD Module Implementation** (Backend + Frontend)
2. **Add Test IDs to UI Components** for reliable element selection
3. **Setup Test Database** with sample data
4. **Execute Full Test Suite** once module is ready
5. **Generate Production Test Report** with actual results
